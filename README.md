# immersive_vehicles_vanity
Immersive Vehicles Vanity (or IVV if you prefer) is an addon pack for Immersive Vehicles that seeks to add comedic value alongside utilitarian vehicles and enticing yet confusing lore to Minecraft.\
This is the repository intended to act as a resource for additional contributor-based content as well as generic backups and a behind-the-scenes view behind nearly every JSON, texture and other tickleable fancies that make up Immersive Vehicles Vanity.

1.12.2 version and 1.16.5 versions available

1.12 has additional back-end features while 1.16.5 only loads into the game as a proper FML-format mod.
\
1.12.2 code is generated using Pylo's MCreator found at https://mcreator.net/ for my convenience and sanity.
